Box Model:

    - The box model is a fundamental concept in CSS where every element is represented as a rectangular box.
    - It consists of four main components: content, padding, border, and margin.
    - Content is the actual content of the element.
    - Padding is the space between the content and the border.
    - Border is the line surrounding the padding.
    - Margin is the space outside the border, which creates separation between elements.


Code:

    .box {
        width: 200px;
        height: 100px;
        padding: 20px;
        border: 2px solid #000;
        margin: 10px;
    }
