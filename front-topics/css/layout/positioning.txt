Positioning:

    - The position property allows you to control the positioning of an element.
    - Values include:
        - static: Default value; elements are positioned according to the normal document flow.
        - relative: Elements are positioned relative to their normal position in the document flow.
        - absolute: Elements are removed from the normal document flow and positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor.
        - fixed: Elements are positioned relative to the viewport, meaning they remain in the same position even when the page is scrolled.
    - Using positioning, you can create complex layouts, overlay elements, and implement scrolling effects.

Code: 

    .relative {
        position: relative;
        left: 50px;
        top: 20px;
    }

    .absolute {
        position: absolute;
        right: 0;
        bottom: 0;
    }

    .fixed {
        position: fixed;
        top: 10px;
        left: 10px;
    }
