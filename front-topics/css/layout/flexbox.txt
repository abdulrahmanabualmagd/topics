Flexbox:

    - Flexbox is a one-dimensional layout model designed for laying out items within a container along a single direction (either horizontally or vertically).
    - It provides properties for distributing space among items, aligning items, and controlling the order of items.
    - Flexbox is particularly useful for creating dynamic layouts that adapt to different screen sizes and orientations.
    - Properties like flex-direction, justify-content, align-items, and flex play key roles in flexbox layouts.


.container {
    display: flex;        /* Enables flexbox layout */
    flex-direction: row;  /* Default: sets the direction of the main axis to be horizontal */
    flex-wrap: nowrap;    /* Default: items will not wrap */
    flex-flow: row nowrap; /* Shorthand for flex-direction and flex-wrap */
    justify-content: flex-start; /* Default: items are packed toward the start of the main axis */
    align-items: stretch; /* Default: items stretch to fill the container's cross axis */
    align-content: stretch; /* Default: lines stretch to fill the container's cross axis */
}

.item {
    flex-grow: 0;         /* Default: items do not grow */
    flex-shrink: 1;       /* Default: items can shrink if needed */
    flex-basis: auto;     /* Default: items size based on their content */
    flex: 0 1 auto;       /* Shorthand for flex-grow, flex-shrink, and flex-basis */
    align-self: auto;     /* Default: aligns the item according to the align-items property of the container */
}
