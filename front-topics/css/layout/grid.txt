Grid Layout:

    - CSS Grid Layout is a two-dimensional layout system that allows you to create grid-based layouts with rows and columns.
    - It provides properties for defining the grid structure, placing items within the grid, and controlling the sizing of grid tracks (rows and columns).
    - Grid Layout is highly versatile and can accommodate complex layouts with ease.
    - Key properties include grid-template-columns, grid-template-rows, grid-gap, grid-column, and grid-row.


Code:

    .grid-container {
        display: grid;
        grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr; /* Three equal columns */
        grid-gap: 10px;
    }

    .grid-item {
        background-color: #ccc;
        padding: 20px;
        text-align: center;
    }
