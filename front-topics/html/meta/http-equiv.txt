   << HTTP-EQUIV >> 

Some of the http-equiv values are no longer commonly used on modern websites, 
as they are better controlled using other methods such as HTTP headers or server-side scripts.

1. Content-Type             : Specifies the character encoding of the HTML document.
2. Refresh                  : Controls automatic page refreshes after a specified time interval.
3. Cache-Control            : Specifies caching behavior for the webpage.
4. Pragma                   : Specifies caching behavior for older browsers that do not support 'cache-control'.
5. Expires                  : Sets an expiration date for the webpage's content.
6. X-UA-Compatible          : Specifies the compatibility mode for the browser.
