// --------------------- [ wchar.h ] -----------------------

/*
wchar.h provides essential functionality for working with wide characters and strings, 
making it possible to handle text data from different languages and character sets 
in C programs.
*/

/*
Types:
-   wchar_t: This is a wide character type that can represent any wide character in the extended character set supported by the system. It's typically an integer type capable of holding values corresponding to wide characters.

Constants:
-   WCHAR_MIN: Minimum value that can be represented by a wchar_t.
-   WCHAR_MAX: Maximum value that can be represented by a wchar_t.

Functions:
-   Wide character I/O functions: Functions like fgetwc(), fputwc(), getwc(), putwc() for reading and writing wide characters to and from streams.
-   Wide character string functions: Functions like wcscpy(), wcsncpy(), wcscat(), wcsncat(), wcslen(), wcschr(), wcscmp(), wcsncmp(), etc., for manipulating wide character strings.
-   Wide character conversion functions: Functions like wcstod(), wcstol(), wcstoul(), wcstoll(), wcstoull(), wcstof(), wcstold(), wcstombs(), mbstowcs(), mbsrtowcs(), wcsrtombs(), etc., for converting between wide character strings and other data types like floating-point numbers and multibyte strings.
-   Wide character classification functions: Functions like iswalpha(), iswdigit(), iswspace(), iswlower(), iswupper(), etc., for classifying wide characters.

Use Cases:
-   wchar.h is commonly used in internationalization and localization tasks where support for extended character sets and multibyte character encodings is required.
-   It's also useful in environments where text processing involves characters from various languages, such as web development, text editors, and graphical user interfaces.
-   Wide character functions and types provided by wchar.h offer a portable and standardized way to work with extended character sets in C programs.
