// --------------------- [ stdbool.h ] -----------------------

/*
stdbool.h provides a standardized way to work with Boolean values in C programs. 
It enhances code readability and maintainability by introducing a dedicated 
Boolean type and macros for true and false values.
*/

/*
Macros and Types:
-   bool: This is a type that represents a Boolean value. It can take two possible values: true or false.
-   true: This macro is defined to represent the truth value, typically equivalent to the integer value 1.
-   false: This macro is defined to represent the false value, typically equivalent to the integer value 0.
-   __bool_true_false_are_defined: This macro is defined after including stdbool.h. Its presence indicates that the macros true and false, as well as the type bool, have been defined.
-   bool, true, and false are often used in conditional expressions and boolean operations to improve code readability and clarity.
